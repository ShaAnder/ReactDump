## Welcome to the React D U M P

## To Start

This is as stated in the main linker fil the dump repo for all my React projects and code snippets. 
I'll try and categorize these by type as I go so please see below for a quick nav bar to each of 
those categories / sub categories.

## Ideas

This is the ideas section, these are all projects or ideas I have started, but not strictly finished yet. I tend to try and finish
whatever I start working on but it isn't always the case. If anything is not currently being worked on / is abandoned it will be 
marked as such in the repo shown.

## Snippets

Finally we have the snippets section, this is where i keep all my single file code snippets i've worked on, I really like making small
things that I can just reuse in other projects or a toolbox rather, and while some of these are stuff i use frequently, this is not 
all of them. I need some secrets after all ðŸ˜‰
